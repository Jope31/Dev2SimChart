# **Composer Data Charting Tool**

A simple, self-contained HTML tool to visualize live and backtest performance for your Composer.trade symphonies. It fetches data directly from the Composer APIs and charts multiple symphonies on a single, interactive graph, making it easy to compare their performance from user-specified start dates.

‚ú® **Features**

‚¶Å	Multi-Symphony Charting: Plot live and backtest data for multiple symphonies on a single graph.<br>
‚¶Å	Clear Visual Comparison: Each symphony is assigned a unique color pair, with a dark shade for live data and a light shade for backtest data, making comparisons intuitive.<br>
‚¶Å	Download Your Chart: Save the generated performance chart as a PNG file with a single click.<br>
‚¶Å	Detailed Status Log: A comprehensive log provides real-time feedback on API requests, data processing, and potential errors.<br>
‚¶Å	Custom Date Ranges: Specify a unique start date for each symphony to align backtests with your analysis needs.<br>
‚¶Å	**Daily P&L Z-Score Ranking**: Automatically calculates and displays a z-score for each symphony's most recent daily performance, ranking them by statistical deviation from their historical backtest.<br>
‚¶Å	Fully Self-Contained: Runs entirely in your browser from a single HTML file‚Äîno installation needed.<br>

üöÄ **How It Works**

This tool is a single HTML file that uses JavaScript to call the official Composer API endpoints.<br>

‚¶Å	Frontend: Plain HTML styled with Tailwind CSS.<br>
‚¶Å	Charting: Uses Chart.js to render the interactive line graphs.<br>
‚¶Å	API Communication: Makes direct fetch requests to the Composer API to get live and backtest data.<br>
‚¶Å	CORS Handling: The Composer APIs require API requests to be made from a server, not directly from a browser. This tool bypasses this restriction by sending requests through a local CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) proxy. You will need to run your own local proxy for the tool to work.

üõ†Ô∏è **Setup and Installation**

This tool requires two components to run locally: a local web server to serve the `index.html` file and a local CORS proxy to handle API requests.

1.  **Run a Local CORS Proxy:**
    The tool is hardcoded to use a proxy at `http://localhost:8080`. The recommended way to set this up is using the `cors-anywhere` package.
    - **Install Node.js:** If you don't have it, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    - **Install `cors-anywhere`:** Open your terminal and run:
      ```bash
      npm install -g cors-anywhere
      ```
    - **Run the proxy:** In the same terminal, run the following command. You must keep this terminal window open while using the tool.
      ```bash
      cors-anywhere
      ```
    This will start the proxy server on port 8080.

2.  **Run a Local Web Server:**
    In a **new** terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved `index.html`. The easiest way to serve the file is with Python's built-in server.
    - **For Python 3:**
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```
    This will start a web server, usually on port 8000.

3.  **Access the Tool:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

# Usage Guide

1.  **Enter Your Credentials:**
    Fill in your Composer API Key, Secret Key, and Account ID. This information is sent directly to the Composer API and is not stored by the tool.

2.  **Add Your Symphonies:**
    In the text area, add the symphonies you want to chart. Use the format `Name,SymphonyID,YYYY-MM-DD`, with one symphony per line. The name can be anything you choose and will be used to label the data in the chart.

    For example:
    ```
    My Core Strategy,FTZP9wjzjvnIw21KQtIL,2025-04-15
    Experimental Algo,anotherSymphonyID,2025-06-01
    ```

3.  **Fetch and Chart Data:**
    Click the "Fetch and Chart Data" button. The status log will show the progress of the API calls. Once finished, the chart will appear below.

4.  **Download the Chart:**
    Click the "Download PNG" button to save a copy of the chart to your computer.

# Z-Score Ranking

Below the main performance chart, you will find the **Daily P&L Z-Score Ranking**. This section provides a powerful statistical snapshot of your symphonies' recent performance.

### What is a Z-Score?
A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. In this tool, it answers the question: **"How unusual was the most recent trading day's profit or loss compared to the symphony's own historical backtest?"**

### How is it Calculated?
For each symphony, the tool performs the following steps:
1.  It takes the Profit & Loss (P&L) of the most recent live trading day.
2.  It calculates the historical daily P&L for the entire duration of the backtest.
3.  It finds the mean (average) and standard deviation (a measure of volatility) of these historical P&Ls.
4.  Finally, it calculates the z-score using the formula:
    `z = (Latest Daily P&L - Historical Mean P&L) / Historical Standard Deviation`

### How to Interpret the Ranking
The symphonies are ranked by their **absolute z-score**, from lowest to highest.
- **Low Z-Score (close to 0):** The most recent day's performance was very typical and falls in line with historical norms.
- **High Positive Z-Score (e.g., > 2.0):** The symphony had a significantly better-than-average day. This is a 2-sigma event, suggesting a positive but statistically unusual outcome.
- **High Negative Z-Score (e.g., < -2.0):** The symphony had a significantly worse-than-average day. This is a negative 2-sigma event, indicating a large, unexpected loss compared to its history.

This ranking helps you quickly identify which strategies are behaving as expected and which are experiencing outlier events that may warrant further investigation.
